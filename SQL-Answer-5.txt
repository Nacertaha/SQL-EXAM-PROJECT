	where not exists (
		select * from Purchase as Pu1
		where C.CustomerId = Pu1.CustomerId
		and Pr.ProductId = Pu1.ProductId 
		-- sub Query to filter customer based on their overall purchases
		-- if we set purchase threshold to 11 instead of 50 we can also include Leo to Sebastien
		and ( select SUM(Pu2.Qty) from Purchase as Pu2
		where C.CustomerId = Pu2.CustomerId
		group by Pu2.CustomerId ) >= 50
